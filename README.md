This is the Section 14 Challenge (Section 13 lessons) Answers

# Installation
Once cloned, the app should be accessible via Xcode 12.4 and above.

# Background
This app is an original stub clone of The App Brewery - thus the AutoLayout, coinManager & initial view controller has a different author.

The challenge was to use the previously learnt topics to then create a segue app that also uses MVC although that was not the main objective rather:
- The Delegate Design View Controller design pattern
- Using Structs as API Data models
- Working with Arrays in a picker (for story scalability)
- Extensions with Light & Dark Mode settings
- Networking & JSON decoding
